# Roving Journeyman

I am a roving journeyman I go from town to town

And wherever I get a job of work I'm willing to sit down

With my bundle on my shoulder, and my grafting tool in hand

It's round the country I will go a roving journeyman.

--

When I come to County Carlow, the girls jump for joy,

Says one unto the other; "Aye here comes a roving boy."

Some meets me with the bottle and the others with a dram

And the toast goes round the table to the roving journeyman

--

Well I had not been in Aberdeen the day but two or three

When a []'s lovely daughter said she wanted to marry me

She told me that she loved me and she took me by the hand

She [] told her mother that she loved the journeyman

--

"Ach, away, ye silly girl, don't bother me no more,

How can ye love a journeyman ye've never seen before?"

Oh hold your tongue oh mother dear, and help me all you can(?)

For round the country I will go with the roving journeyman
